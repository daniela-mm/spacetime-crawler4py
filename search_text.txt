making big data active:  petabytes 
megafolks  milliseconds

first-generation big data management efforts  given us mapreduce-based frameworks 
 hadoop, pig,  hive (  recently spark)  focus  --fact data analytics,
key-value ("nosql") stores  provide scalable key-based record storage  retrieval,  
handful  specialized systems  target problems like parallel graph analytics  data stream
analysis.  project aims  continuously  reliably capture big data arising  social,
mobile, web,  sensed data sources  enable timely delivery  information  users 
indicated interests.   nutshell,  aim  develop techniques  enable  accumulation 
monitoring  petabytes  data  potential interest  millions  end users;  "interesting"
new data appears,    delivered  end users   timeframe measured  (100's )
milliseconds.  effort involves challenges related  parallel databases, big data platforms,
stream data management,  publish/subscribe systems.  will require massively scaling 
solutions  individual problems  well  integrating  results   coherent overall software
architecture.
  "data " side,  technical challenges    addressing include resource
management   large scale lsm-based storage systems   provision   highly available
 elastic facility  fast data ingestion.   "inside",  challenges include  parallel
evaluation   large number  declarative data subscriptions  (multiple) highly partitioned
data sets. amplifying  challenge   need  efficiently support spatial, temporal,  similarity
predicates  data subscriptions. big data also makes result ranking  diversification techniques
critical  order  large result sets   manageable.   "data " side,  technical
challenges include  reliable  timely dissemination  data  interest   sometimesconnected
subscriber base  unprecedented scale.  software basis   work  asterixdb,
 open-source big data management system (bdms)  supports  scalable storage,
searching,  analysis  mass quantities  semi-structured data.  leveraging asterixdb, 
project aims   next step  big data management: creating  "active bdms"   open
source prototype  will  made available   big data research community.
